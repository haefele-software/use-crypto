# Contributing to use-crypto

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## Our Development Process

Some individuals will be working on GitHub which means that those changes are public from the start. Other changesets will come via a bridge with Haefele Software's internal source control. This is beneficial and a necessity as often new features are trialled internally before moving them to open source libraries/client applications.
